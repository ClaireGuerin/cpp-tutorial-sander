// Integer versus floating-point arithmetic.
/* What is the value of the integer variables i and j after the following statements?
(a) i = 2 / 5 * 3; j = 3 * 2 / 5; -> i = 0, j = 1
(b) i = 2.0 / 5 * 3; j = 2 / 5 * 3.0; -> i = 1.2, j = 0
The evaluation of the expressions in (b) involves implicit type conversion.
(c) Rewrite the expressions such that all type conversions are explicit.*/

// The Quetelet index. 
/* The Quetelet, or Body Mass Index (BMI), is used in medicine as a normalised measure of tissue mass in an individual, 
allowing that person to be classified as underweight, normal weight or obese. 
The Quetelet index Q is defined as the body mass (M, measured in kilograms) 
divided by the square of the body height (h, measured in meters), i.e., Q = M/h^2. 
Write a program that asks the user to enter weight and height via the keyboard. 
After reading in those values, the program should calculate the Quetelet index and report the result back to the user. 
You should start worrying about your weight, or about bugs in your program, if the result does not fall in the range 18.0-30.0. */

// An age and birthday calculator. 
/* Write a program that reads from keyboard input your date of birth and todayâ€™s date 
and that calculates your age and the number of days until your next birthday (display these results on screen). 
For simplicity, assume that a year has 365 days, and that a month has 30 days. Hint: make use of the modulo operator (%). */
